# Laser Engraver
Documentation for 40W DIY-Laser-Engraver

This laser engraver uses a 40W 450nm blue laser to engrave materials such as wood, leather and anodized aluminium. It is controlled by LaserGRBL software on an Arduino and uses Nema17 stepper motors, MGN15H linear rails and GT2 timing belts to move the laser module in x- and y-direction.
